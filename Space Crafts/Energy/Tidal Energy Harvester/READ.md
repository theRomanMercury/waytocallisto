**Tidal Energy Harvester**

**Structure and Framework**:
- The TEH is composed of a modular lattice framework, resembling a mesh structure that can be expanded to accommodate the desired number of grid units.
- Each grid unit consists of lightweight, interconnected struts forming a hexagonal pattern.
- The materials used for the lattice are selected for their low mass, durability, and resistance to space conditions.

**Flexible PVDF Membrane Unit**:
- Within each grid unit, a flexible PVDF membrane module is centrally positioned.
- The PVDF membrane module comprises a circular frame that securely holds the PVDF membrane layers.

**Membrane Layers**:
1. **Outer Protective Layer**:
   - The outermost layer of the PVDF membrane is a thin, transparent film that shields against micrometeoroid impacts and harmful radiation.
   - It's engineered to be durable and self-healing to mitigate minor damage.

2. **Piezoelectric PVDF Layer**:
   - Beneath the protective layer, the core of the PVDF membrane is a piezoelectric PVDF layer.
   - This layer contains embedded piezoelectric crystals that generate electrical potential when subjected to mechanical stress.

3. **Inner Support Layer**:
   - A flexible, yet sturdy, support layer reinforces the back of the PVDF membrane.
   - This layer maintains the structural integrity of the membrane while allowing it to flex.

**Mechanical Deformation and Energy Conversion**:
- As the TEH orbits, tidal forces cause the lattice structure to respond by slightly distorting its shape.
- This deformation is transferred to the PVDF membranes within each grid unit.
- The stretching and compression of the PVDF membrane generates mechanical stress, which is transformed into electrical voltage by the piezoelectric PVDF layer.

**Energy Conversion Modules**:
- Inside each grid unit, compact energy conversion modules are positioned adjacent to the PVDF membrane.
- These modules include rectifiers to convert alternating voltage to direct current, voltage regulators for stable output, and capacitors for energy storage.

**Control and Alignment Systems**:
- Distributed across the TEH lattice, alignment thrusters and gyroscopic stabilizers ensure that the lattice remains optimally oriented relative to tidal forces.
- Data from onboard sensors and monitoring systems inform the thrusters and stabilizers, enabling precise adjustments.

**Wireless Energy Transmission**:
- The harvested energy is collected from each energy conversion module and directed to a central energy storage unit.
- From the central unit, energy is wirelessly transmitted to Earth through high-efficiency microwave or laser power transmission technologies.

**Innovations and Challenges Addressed**:
- The PVDF membranes are engineered to maintain flexibility while withstanding extreme temperatures, radiation, and impacts.
- The lattice framework ensures scalability, adaptability, and uniform energy capture across the TEH.
- Alignment and control systems incorporate advanced AI algorithms for real-time adjustments.
- Integration of cutting-edge wireless energy transmission technology minimizes energy loss during transmission.

Remember that this detailed visual description is still a conceptual representation, and translating it into an actual design would require collaboration with experts in space technology, engineering, and design.
